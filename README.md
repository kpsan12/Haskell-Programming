# Haskell Learning 

Welcome to my Haskell learning repository! This project serves as a personal record of my journey as I learn and experiment with the Haskell programming language. The code here represents a collection of exercises, implementations, and notes that I am using to explore the functional programming paradigm and improve my understanding of Haskell.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to:

- Document my learning progress with Haskell.
- Provide examples of various concepts, patterns, and techniques as I explore the language.
- Serve as a resource for my future reference and for others who are also learning Haskell.

## Structure

The repository contains the following:

- **Code examples**: Various Haskell scripts showcasing concepts from beginner to intermediate levels.
- **Exercises**: Solutions to problems and challenges encountered while learning Haskell.
- **Documentation**: Notes and observations made during my learning process.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress and is not intended for production use. It is primarily for personal educational purposes and to track my learning journey.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback or suggestions!
